# Rules Engine Demo App: Interactive Full-Stack Solution for Rule Processing.

This repository contains a simple full-stack application built using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. It provides both a user-friendly interface and backend functionalities to interact with the [MQTT-Integrated Rule Processing System](https://github.com/neslihanaydin/RulesEngineMqtt).
The application is already live and accessible at [Rules Engine Application](https://rules-engine-app.vercel.app). 

## Prerequisites

1. Rule Processing Application: Ensure that the [MQTT-Integrated Rule Processing System](https://github.com/neslihanaydin/RulesEngineMqtt) is running in a Docker container or on your local machine. Follow the instructions in that repository to set it up.
2. A web browser to access the application interface in this [link](https://rules-engine-app.vercel.app/).

## Submitting Inputs
1. Fill in the required fields in the form on the website.
2. Click the Submit button to send your inputs.

## Publishing and Subscribing
This application handles the following MQTT operations in the background:
   * **Publish**: Sends your inputs to the MQTT input topic of the main Rules Engine Backend Application.
   * **Subscribe**: Listens to the MQTT output topic for processed results.

## Displaying Results
Once the backend processes the inputs, the output is displayed directly on the webpage.
